# Python_Project
This Jarvis System needs python 3.10, due to LLM Gemini Model

Jarvis System is an intelligent voice-based AI assistant built using Python that integrates Google's Gemini LLM (Large Language Model) via API for natural language understanding and response generation. This project uses speech_recognition to capture voice commands from the user, processes them using the Gemini Pro model through the official Generative AI API, and responds intelligently based on the query. The text response is then converted into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and played back to the user.

A user-friendly interface is developed using Streamlit, where users can interact with Jarvis through a simple button click. The app also allows users to view, listen to, and download the AI's spoken response. Logging is implemented to monitor application flow and debug issues efficiently. Overall, Jarvis System demonstrates an end-to-end AI workflow combining speech, LLMs, interactive assistant experience.
